## Presentation I

Alexander Haurin,
Liying Qin
& Griffin Jordan

- Intro (10 minutes)
  
  - Explanation of goals we are aiming to achieve for our networking team:
    - Flawless multiplayer over a flawed system (expanding on what we mean by flawless e.g., synchronicity and scale)
    - how our approach will differ from other types of games (real-time FPS vs. a turn based card game)
  - Networked multiplayer in older games (90s to early 2000s)
    - Explain differnces of Peer-to-peer (P2P) vs Client-Server model
        - bandwidth limitations
        - why one is better than the other
    - LAN reducing latency, but comes with tradeoffs like connectivity over distance
    - Latency problems on networked connection: i.e handling of dropped connections and reconnecting
    - Explain how detecting and preventing cheating was much harder back then
    - Shining examples: DOOM, Unreal Tournament, Goldeneye and Mario Kart 64 (true pioneers)
  - Networked multiplayer in modern games (2010s to present)
    - Show how server architecture has greatly improved with things like dedicated servers and cloud-based solutions and saving
    - Real-time game data streaming (this will be important for our stretch goal of a stats & leaderboard system)
    - Show how scale and synchronicity has improved with time. Even complex ideas like cross-platform multiplayer that games can still struggle with today
    - Majority of games today come with the assumption of some level of multiplayer functionality
    - Shining examples: minecraft, GTA, Halo and of course **Counter-Strike**
  - Our approach to networking and how it differs/is similar to older and modern multiplayer networking solutions
  - Player host approach
  
- Server Implementation (15 minutes)
  - rust std::net
  - State Management
    - will be representing players cards, chips/$ amount, actual players and more
    - synchronization of these components across all clients is neccessary for proper game flow
    - things like the river cards should be represented on each players game. Can't have different river cards for different players
    - state management is incredibly important to keep the competitive integrity of poker alive
  - Lobby & Matchmaking system
    - Explaination of lobbys in poker game
    - player host creates a lobby or room which has a unique code
    - other players who wish to join can do so by entering a code generated by the host
    - Once everyone is in, game may begin
    - termination of game occurs when host chooses so. Specific triggers to allow for the start and stop of a game or lobby
    
- Client-Server Communication (10 minutes)
  - Player as host implementation
  - describe the cost and benefits of this approach
  - desirable experience for the host, other players may not have the same.
  - expand on this by showing the path data must go to be reached by players ... peer --> host --> peer
  - Serde
  - Protocol design
  - even though poker is turn based, we still must ensure each turn is the same for everyone
  - ex: game events such as the dealing of cards need to be represented on everyones screen
      - though some data needs to be hidden from users, most notably other players hands
  - player actions like betting, folding, checking, etc. and how we communicate that with other players
    - sure, its okay for other players to know something like a bet amount
  - game state updates
    - do we really need to transmit certain data to all players the time? No, some things are just not that important or act as unneccessary overhead and can stay localized 
      until needed. 
  - How we plan to handle latency, even though poker is not real-time

- Connection Management (10 minutes)
  - Accidental disconneciton is a very real problem
  - how we plan to handle such a case
  - reconnection and a saved game state
  - ambitious, but replacing disconnected player with bot
  - we don't just want the game to end and drop connection if one player in game gets disconnected
  - no one likes getting the "failure to connect to server" error, this can be better managed with our approach to implementing multiplayer
  - showcase how by having a player host and peer to peer type of networked multiplayer, we dont need to rely on outside servers to be running


## Presentation II

- UDP Connections and Reliability (15 minutes)
  - What does TCP offer that UDP doesn't have
  - Why we can't use TCP for an action game
  - How to replicate connections in UDP
  - How to replicate packet ordering in UDP
  - How to replicate packet resending in UDP
  - How to handle congestion
  - Case study by explaining host.rs
- Game synchronization and agreement (15 minutes)
  - Everyone is simulating the game locally
  - The host is the source of truth for what really happened
  - Describe the flow of information
  - Describe sources of latency
  - Describe clientside prediction
  - Describe prediction correction
  - Case study in collisions with the local player
- Lag compensation (15 minutes)
  - Because of latency, actions made by the player arrive at the server when state has changed
  - For fairness, a player should have their inputs evaluated against the state in which they were created
  - solutions: delay, lag comp, rollback
  - delay means that you see your own inputs late, rather than predicting them you wait for the server to respond
  - lag comp means you predict, and when the server gets your inputs it checks how the world looked at the time of input and applies the effect that would occur. meaning you can get shot through walls.
  - rollback is like lag comp, but instead of just applying the effect at that point in time it is received, it resimulates the world from the input onward as if the input had come in earlier.
  - why we aren't doing true rollback and instead doing lag comp
